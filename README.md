# Project 1 CS 178: Spring 2025
## James Axe

## Introduction
In this project, users are able to create a profile and then select the countries they want in their top 10 list of the most populated cities in those countries. Users can select an infinite number of countries. If a user changes their name, they're able to do so using the update user function. If they enter an invalid email, they're sent back to the home page and told the update failed and to try again. Additionally, users are able to delete their accounts if they don't want their data stored anymore. Users are also able to sign in after making an account. This makes it much simpler for returning users.


## How to Install/Run


## Dependencies
This code relies on the user having Flask, pymysql, and boto3 installed on their terminal. The requirements file is included in the repository, so you just need to download Flask, pymysql, and boto3 as they're imported through the dbcode file. Having a strong internet connection is also a must for this code to run.
